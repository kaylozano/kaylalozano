**Stuff to know about me:**
 
   1. I generally work 9-5:30pm but shift this up or down depending on project need and personal commitments.
   2. My work hours may not be your work hours. I expect that you will respond during your own work hours. 
   3. I like to leverage the [Eisenhower Matrix](https://www.eisenhower.me/eisenhower-matrix/) in order to continually gut-check urgency versus significance to best focus my time and energy on the right things
   4. I care most about what is best for the user - this is not always as easy or simple as it sounds.  
   5. I am generally a self-starter and don't require micro-management.  
   6. I have a high value for efficiency and organization. If I notice a process that can be improved to either allow for a higher level of efficiency or better cross-team collaboration, then I will probably suggest a process upgrade. 
   7. I value progress over perfection. 
   8. I always welcome feedback. I will, more than likely, actively ask for feedback but feel free to volunteer thoughts at any time. Thank you in advance!
   9. I strive to balance being present, while always being a forward-thinker. 
   10. I love being the glue. Bringing teams together to align on goals and process. Improving workflows. Adapting process and presentations to accommodate higher levels of cross-team collaboration. Measuring and monitoring success. These are fun challenges. 
   

**Fun Facts:**   
   1. I am a tango and bachata dancer. When I am not working or with family, I am most likely on the dance floor. 
   2. One of the most fun projects I have worked on was as a product manager for a startup working in the healthcare IP space. I managed the design and development of an AR software prototype to aide spinal surgeons in the operating room. 
   3. My family is Argentine so, yes, we love to eat, be with family, and scream at the TV while watching f√∫tbol. 
   4. Coming from a latin culture, food is incredibly important and central to relationships and family gatherings. My partner is vegan and so I am currently on an adventure to learn how to cook vegan. All recommendations are welcome :)
